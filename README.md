# Candyman Project

This is a playground project around Arduino and all the related tecnologies related with this awesome microcontroller. The main goal is to build a self-balancing robot and learn a lot on the jorney. 

Each single step and topic learnt will be named Candyman Number 1, Candyman Number 2, .... and so on. Inside each one of these subprojects I will try to provide as much info as possible alogn with Fritxing files, Arduino source code or Processing apps.
