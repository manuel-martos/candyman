# Candyman Number 03

Hi again.

In this new candyman project we are going to mix a lot of stuff together. The main goal is control a RGB Led with an Ionic Fitbit Smartwatch.

We are going to create a Fitbit App with Fitbit Studio with the minimal UI to specify red, green and blue components. Those values will be somehow send to the RGB Led in realtime. Something like Philips Hue bulbs but under the DIY umbrella.

The middleware between the Smartwatch and the RGB Led will include: Heroku, Raspberry and Arduino.

Let's start!

# Arduino Sketch

You can take a look at the source code of the sketch that will control the RGB Led, placed at [/number3/arduino-rgb-led](/number3/arduino-rgb-led).
